# Poseidon-share
This is a repository to share notebooks, documents, code, etc, regarding the [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon-ocean.net/) project. Run these notebooks on [SciServer](https://sciserver.org/) using the Oceanography image.

`Gallery` contains notebooks to make cool figures using SciServer, OceanSpy, and Poseidon project datasets. For high-resolution results, change the parameters from "test" to "production" values and prepare to wait.

`OceanSpy` contains demonstration notebooks to use various Poseidon-project datasets on SciServer using the [OceanSpy](https://oceanspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.

`OceanSpy/img` contains images for the notebooks.

`OceanSpy/test_data` contains observation datafiles for `LLC90_SciServer_tutorial.ipynb`.
