# Poseidon-share
This is a repository to share notebooks, documents, code, etc, regarding the Poseidon project.

`gallery` contains notebooks to make cool figures using SciServer, OceanSpy, and Poseidon project datasets. For high-resolution results, change the parameters from "test" to "production" values and prepare to wait.

`img` contains images for the notebooks.

`test_data` contains observation datafiles for `LLC90_SciServer_tutorial.ipynb`.
